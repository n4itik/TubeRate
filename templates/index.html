                    <h4>What is TubeRate ?</h4>
                    <p>TubeRate allows the user to view ratings of YouTube videos which will be based on sentiment
                        analysis performed on the comments of those videos. The app will extract comments from the
                        video, process them using NLP and show
                        ratings to the user based upon the emotions present in them. These ratings will be on a scale
                        from 1 to 5, where 1 means extremely dissatisfied and 5 means extremely pleased with the content
                        of the video.

                    </p>

                    <h4>Why is it needed ?</h4>
                    <p>Thousands of hours worth of content is being created and shared on YouTube throughout the day. It
                        has become really difficult to spend time watching such videos which may have a longer duration
                        than expected and sometimes our efforts
                        may become futile if we couldn't find relevant information out of it. There are times when we
                        are searching for something on YouTube and there are a lot of videos about it and we canâ€™t just
                        rely on the number of likes/dislikes a
                        particular video has.
