# TubeRate
YouTube video rating web app based on sentiment analysis of comments.

TubeRate allows the user to view ratings of YouTube videos which will be based on sentiment analysis performed on the comments of those videos. The app will extract comments from the video, process them using NLP and show ratings to the user based upon the emotions present in them. These ratings will be on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means extremely dissatisfied and 5 means extremely pleased with the content of the video.

Built using Flask and Bootstrap.
